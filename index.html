                        Hi, I am Kevin! I am a Full-Stack-Developer from Germany – Hamburg, to be precise. I got into software development out of curiosity for the things happening behind the curtain of the internet. Hard work and determination allowed me to come from passion to being a professional web developer.

                        Like many other developers, I got my basic development skills by just diving right into it. Learning to code requires loads of practice, so I started writing programs for anything I could think of to expand my knowledge. While this approach served me very well, I eventually decided to get a proper academic foundation as well to dig even deeper.

                        After graduating in Business Informatics at a German university, I gathered many years of practical experience as a web developer in several exciting projects, both personal and professional. With lots and lots of practice came proficiency in various languages, platforms and frameworks.

                        But in programming, especially in web development, you’re never done learning. It requires constant refining of the existing skillset as well as an open mind towards new technologies. It requires an open mind as well as constant refinement of the skillset. This makes it easy to work in unknown environments – because in the end it’s all just code!
