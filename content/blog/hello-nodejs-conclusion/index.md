This is the end of our basic Hello World introduction of how to setup a server with NodeJS. We are now able to use npm to our advantage and learned about the general structure of a NodeJS-Project. We know how to deliver pages using ExpressJS and how routing between pages works. Dealing with sessions in NodeJS is not a problem for us anymore. We also covered how to connect NodeJS to a database using Mongo and Mongoose. Finally we even implemented a login-system with PassportJS.

I've given you the basics, but there's plenty more to learn about NodeJS and its components. I hope I'm leaving you with enough foundation to build upon and encourage you to dive into more advanced topics and develop the most amazing NodeJS-projects the world has ever seen!
