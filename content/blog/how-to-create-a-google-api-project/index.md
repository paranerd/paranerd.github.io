Since I frequently look stuff like this up on the web, I decided to assemble a comprehensive Step-by-Step-Tutorial that you can follow to obtain an OAuth Client-ID to access Google's APIs.

- Open theÂ [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/projectcreate)

- Choose a name for your project

- Click **Create** and wait for the project to be created

- Once the little progress indicator in the upper right corner stopped spinning, click on it

- Alternatively refresh your [Dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) to see the new project appear in the dropdown list at the top

- In the left sidebar select **APIs and Services**

- Under **Dashboard** you may add any API your project needs acces to

- Select **Credentials** from the sidebar

- Switch to the **OAuth consent screen** tab

- Fill in the blanks and hit **Save**

- You will be redirected to create your OAuth-Client-ID

- Choose **Web application** and give it a name

- Enter your domain for **Authorized JavaScript origin**

- You will be prompted with your Client-ID as well as the key

- **Done**.
