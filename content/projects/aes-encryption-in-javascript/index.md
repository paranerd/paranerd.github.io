In this project I created an AES-module that can do symmetric encryption and decryption in JavaScript. Iâ€™m using standard libraries included in CryptoJS. The module can encrypt, optionally sign, and of course decrypt text directly in the browser. As a standalone module it can easily be integrated in other projects as well.
