The "Immocation Standort Tool" is a tool for real estate investors to evaluate locations based on a variety of factors such as current and expected population, unemployment rate, prices for buying and selling properties, number of students and so on. The project is powered by the MEAN stack, so it shows an Angular frontend that's served by a REST API running on NodeJS with Express and a Mongo database.
